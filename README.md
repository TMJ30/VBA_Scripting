## Analyzing Stock Market Data with VBA
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
  * Ticker symbol
  * Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of the quarter
  * Percente change between opening price and closing price between the beginning and ending of the quarter
  * Total stock volume of the stock
  * Add functionality to the scrip to return the stock with the **Greatest percente increase**, **Greatest percent decrease** and **Greatest total volume** (See image 2)
